## Development rules and principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

### Design Principles

- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, class, and module should have one clear purpose.
- **Fail Fast**: Check for potential errors early and raise exceptions immediately when issues occur.

### File and Function Limits

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code**. If approaching this limit, refactor by splitting into modules.
- **Functions should be under 50 lines** with a single, clear responsibility.
- **Classes should be under 100 lines** and represent a single concept or entity.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.

### Reports

For each coding session, request the ticket tag name, checkout a new branch with that name, and create a report 
file named after the branch in the [reports](docs/reports) folder. Include the date inside the report. 
Populate this file with a checklist plan and mark steps as completed with a short report on what was done to complete it. 

**When creating any todo list, always include "Update current report to reflect the implemented changes" as the final item.**
